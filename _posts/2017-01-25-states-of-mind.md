I published a blog on the Bedford Bugle - the University College London Psychology Society's blog. This blog was a review of the 'States of Mind' exhibition at the Wellcome Collection. The exhibition brought together works of artists, psychologists, philosophers and neuroscientists, exploring phenomena such as somnambulism (sleepwalking), synaesthesia (a sensation in one of the senses, such as hearing, triggering a sensation in another, such as taste) and memory disorders, interrogating our understanding of the conscious experience.
