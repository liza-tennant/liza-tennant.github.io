I am an AI Scientist + Social Scientist looking to build moral alignment _into_ AI agents. Currently I am studying this in multi-agent simulations with independent learning agents, using systems based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and foundation models (LLMs such as Gemma2), with inspiration from moral philosophy, psychology and game theory. 

In my latest work I have developed a methodology for quantifying key moral philosophical frameworks in terms of actions and consequences on an environment, modeled these as intrinsic rewards for training RL agents playing social dilemma games (see [IJCAI'23 paper](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/36)), simulated societies of agents with diverse moral preferences, implemented multi-agent RL with partner selection, investigated coalition formation, the emergence of cooperation and exploitation in morally heterogeneous societies (see [AIES'24 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04202)), and applied this framework to fine-tuning LLM agents to play more morally aligned policies in interactive game environments (see [ICLR'25 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639)).  

I'm a final-year PhD candidate at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.machineintelligencelab.ai/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I am funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain. Before my PhD I studied Psychology & Linguistics (@ UCL), conducted computational social science research in political psychology using Twitter data (@ University of Cambridge), and worked as an AI/Data Scientist and Behavioural Scientist at two start-ups and a large investment bank.

I'm in the process of changing my last name from Karmannaya to Tennant. If you see different names listed on different publications, don't get confused :)
