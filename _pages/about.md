I am an AI Alignment researcher looking to build moral alignment _into_ AI agents. Until recently I've been studying this problem in my PhD through multi-agent simulations with independent learning agents, using systems based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and foundation models (LLMs such as Gemma2), with inspiration from moral philosophy, psychology and game theory. Now I am a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.

In my latest work I have developed a methodology for quantifying key moral philosophical frameworks in terms of actions and consequences on an environment, modeled these as intrinsic rewards for training RL agents playing social dilemma games (see [IJCAI'23 paper](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/36)), simulated societies of agents with diverse moral preferences, implemented multi-agent RL with partner selection, investigated coalition formation, the emergence of cooperation and exploitation in morally heterogeneous societies (see [AIES'24 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04202)), and applied this framework to fine-tuning LLM agents to play more morally aligned policies in interactive game environments (see [ICLR'25 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639)).  

I did my PhD at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.machineintelligencelab.ai/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I was funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain. Before my PhD I studied Psychology & Linguistics (@ UCL), conducted computational social science research in political psychology using Twitter data (@ University of Cambridge), and worked as an AI/Data Scientist and Behavioural Scientist at two start-ups and a large investment bank.
