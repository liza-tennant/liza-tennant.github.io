I was invited to teach two lectures per year, for two consecutive years (2021 and 2022), on the ‘Language and Communication’ module on the UCL BSc Psychology &Language Sciences programme. My lectures covered Natural Language Processing techniques, collecting data from social media, and my own research in Political Psychology and Linguistics.
